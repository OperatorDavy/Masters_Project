These are the Matlab scripts used for genertaing the synthetic data used for training.

The runBatches3D.mat and get_mask.mat were written by me. Other codes were not written by me, but were heavily modified.


Note that I did not put the actuall data, since it is medical and many issues will rise. Also, there is a file 
missing called gridding. This has all the code for the gridding operations, however it is too big for github and seems to be 
proprietary code so I did not include it.
