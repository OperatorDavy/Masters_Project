# The scripts for the model
This directory contains all the clean codes for the models commented and explained. To see them in action, check the Results directory

# Contents:
unet: scripts for the unet training

crnn: scritps for the crnn training

The other files are codes that I used to quantitatively assess the results (image_quality_metrics.py) and loading the checkpoints 
(model_checkpoint_loader.py)
